For my test case workLoad E I implemented a random variable with the size of the malloc.
The random value would be malloced to a pointer than immediatly freed.

For workLoad F I malloced a random size between 1 to 25 one the pointers then freed each of them.
These tests were interesting because you can see the difference between the time it takes to malloc
a pointer of a random size multiple times versus just a constant size.
